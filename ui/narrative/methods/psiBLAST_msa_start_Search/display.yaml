parameters :
    input_msa_ref:
        ui-name : |
            Query MSA
        short-hint : |
            A protein multiple sequence alignment (MSA) that includes the query sequences of interest. The MSA can be created with Apps such as MUSCLE or HMMER and can be trimmed using the Gblocks App.
    input_many_refs:
        ui-name : |
            Search Database
        short-hint : |
            The KBase data object with proteins to be searched. Objects may be a FeatureSet, Genome, or GenomeSet.
    output_filtered_name:
        ui-name : |
            Output Object
        short-hint : |
            The name of the FeatureSet object containing any resulting BLAST hits to the supplied query MSA.
    e_value:
        ui-name : |
            E-value Threshold
        short-hint : |
            The maximum e-value threshold for hits. The default is 0.001, but the number could also be written in exponential notation (e.g., 1E-3). All output will ignore hits with e-values greater than the e-value threshold.
    bitscore:
        ui-name : |
            Bit Score Threshold
        short-hint : |
            The minimum bit score threshold for hits.
    overlap_fraction:
        ui-name : |
            Alignment Coverage Threshold (%)
        short-hint : |
            The minimum alignment coverage threshold for hits (1-100). Labeled as ALN_LEN in the outpu.
    maxaccepts:
        ui-name : |
            Max Accepts
        short-hint : |
            Hard limit for the maximum number of hits in the result (default is 1000).
    output_extra_format:
        ui-name : |
            Extra Text Output Format
        short-hint : |
            Specify the format for an additional output file. Tab-delimited output is always generated as a default. This option is for one additional file. These options are described in the <a href=”https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279684/”>NCBI BLAST</a> documentation.
